# WaveGuide - Surf and Tide Forecasts

This project uses a React front end to show the user the current and 3-day surf conditions for a given location as entered in a search bar. It shows any active warnings in effect, wave height, high and low tide, and wind speed. It also allows for three favourite locations to be saved and recalled.
